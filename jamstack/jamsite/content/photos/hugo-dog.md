## HUGO the Dog!

Feeling mad hostile, ran the apostle, flowing like Christ when I speak the gospel. Olympic torch flaming we burn so sweet, the thrill of victory the agony defeat. So uhh, tic toc and keep ticking, while I get you flipping off what I'm kicking.

Olympic torch flaming we burn so sweet, the thrill of victory the agony defeat. Domino effect arts and crafts, paragraphs contain cyanide. It was the night before New Year's all through the projects, not a handgun was silent, not even a Tec.

Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics, graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths. I breaks it down to the bone gristle, Ill speaking Scud missile heat seeking, Johnny Blazing.
