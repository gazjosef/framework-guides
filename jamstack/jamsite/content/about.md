# About JAMSite

Some info regarding this site at the top level...

My beats travel like a vortex through your spine, to the top of your cerebral cortex. I bomb atomically Socrates' philosophies and hypothesis can't define how I be dropping these mockeries.

I smoke on the mic like smoking Joe Frazier, the hell raiser, raising hell with the flavor. So uhh, tic toc and keep ticking, while I get you flipping off what I'm kicking.

My beats travel like a vortex through your spine, to the top of your cerebral cortex. Nightmares like Wes Craven people gunning, my third eye seen it coming, before it happened.
