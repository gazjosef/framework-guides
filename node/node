What is Node.Js?

- JavaScript Runtime (Not a Language or a Framework)
- Built on the V8 JavaScript Engine

Essentially allows us to run JavaScript on the Server


Why Use Node?

- Fast, efficient and highly scalable
- Event driven, non-blocking I/O model
- Popular in the industry
- Same Language on the front and back end

Non-Blocking I/O

- Works on a single thread using non-blocking I/O calls
- Supports tens of thousands concurrent connections
- Optimizes throughput & scalability in apps with many I/O operations
- All of this makes Node.js apps very fast and efficient

Node's Event Loop

Single threaded
Supports con-currency via events & callbacks
Event Emitter is used to bind events and listeners
