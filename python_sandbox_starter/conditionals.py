# If/ Else conditions are used to decide to do something based on something being true or false

x = 6
y = 10

# Comparison Operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=) - Used to compare values

# Simple if
if x == y:
    print(f"{x} is equal to {y}")

# If/else
# if x > y:
#     print(f"{x} is greater than {y}")
# else:
#     print(f"{x} is less than {y}")

# Elif
# if x > y:
#     print(f"{x} is greater than {y}")
# elif x==y:
#     print(f"{x} is equal to {y}")
# else:
#     print(f"{x} is less than {y}")

# Nested if
if x > 2:
    if x <= 10:
        print(f"{x} is less than 2 and greater than 10")
# Logical operators (and, or, not) - Used to combine conditional statements




# Membership Operators (not, not in) - Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object




# Identity Operators (is, is not) - Compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:
