      Float is a CSS positioning property. Floated elements remain a part of the
      flow of the page, and will affect the positioning of other elements (e.g.
      text will flow around floated elements), unlike position: absolute
      elements, which are removed from the flow of the page. The CSS clear
      property can be used to be positioned below left/right/both floated
      elements. If a parent element contains nothing but floated elements, its
      height will be collapsed to nothing. It can be fixed by clearing the float
      after the floated elements in the container but before the close of the
      container. The .clearfix hack uses a clever CSS pseudo selector (:after)
      to clear floats. Rather than setting the overflow on the parent, you apply
      an additional class clearfix to it. Then apply this CSS:
