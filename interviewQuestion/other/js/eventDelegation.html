    <h1>What is Event Delegation?</h1>
    <p>
      #1 A way you can add an event listener once for multiple elements with
      support for adding extra children.
    </p>
    <p>
      #2 Explain event delegation: Event delegation is a technique involving
      adding event listeners to a parent element instead of adding them to the
      descendant elements. The listener will fire whenever the event is
      triggered on the descendant elements due to event bubbling up the DOM. The
      benefits of this technique are: Memory footprint goes down because only
      one single handler is needed on the parent element, rather than having to
      attach event handlers on each descendant. There is no need to unbind the
      handler from elements that are removed and to bind the event for new
      elements.

    <ul id="myList">
      <li>Apple</li>
      <li>Bananas</li>
      <li>Tomatoes</li>
    </ul>
    <script>
      const myList = document.getElementById("myList");

      myList.addEventListener("click", e => {
        const target = e.target;
        if (target.matches("li")) {
          target.style.backgroundColor = "red";
        }
      });
      const newLi = document.createElement("li");
      newLi.textContent = "dcode";

      myList.appendChild(newLi);
